      <description>Introduction You are somewhat familiar with Kubernetes and you came across Keptn. You want to contribute but you are someone who falls into one of the following categories:
 You haven&amp;rsquo;t contributed to an open source project before The idea of going from zero to contributing to a big project like Keptn sounds overwhelming to you You would like someone who has done it tell you what exactly you need to do to get your first PR in You are a fan of TODO guides and would like a reference for making your own TODO guide for contributing to Keptn  Or something else that I might have missed.</description>

      <description>Part I: https://vadasambar.com/post/kubernetes/keptn/dev-setup/
This post details:
 Considering each option listed in Part I in more detail What I eventually ended up with. Hopefully 1 and 2 can give you some idea about what you can do for your local Keptn dev setup.  I have not included many pros and cons for each setup because most of them are covered in Part I.
Solution 1. Buy a new machine This is a good solution if you are planning to buy a new machine or if are ready to buy a machine just for Keptn development.</description>

      <description>Based on my Keptn slack thread: https://keptn.slack.com/archives/CGS63H8G6/p1634057060065400
I am sharing this here with a paraphrase to the original thread and some extra info. This is so that:
 The entire thing is available publicly (Keptn slack needs signing up) (hopefully) Gives the original thread more context and structure with some follow up information  Problem: Keptn local development setup can be heavy if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a computer with good specifications.</description>
