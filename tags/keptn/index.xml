      <description>Problem How do you start contributing code to Keptn?
Solution You don&amp;rsquo;t have to do all of them. I have included everything I did.
A: Understand what Keptn is all about  Go through the official website Join Keptn slack (&amp;lt;- to ask questions if you get stuck during Quickstart) Try out the Quickstart (if you are stuck ask for help in #help or #general) Go through the slide deck What is Keptn Go through Where does Keptn fit in the existing Cloud Native landscape Watch Overcoming (organizational) scalability issues in your Prometheus ecosystem - JÃ¼rgen Etzlstorfer Go through Keptn Full Tour on Prometheus or Keptn Full Tour on Dynatrace If you still don&amp;rsquo;t have a big-picture idea of what Keptn is, join Keptn slack.</description>

      <description>Part I: https://vadasambar.com/post/kubernetes/keptn/dev-setup/
This post details:
 Considering each option listed in Part I in more detail What I eventually ended up with. Hopefully 1 and 2 can give you some idea about what you can do for your local Keptn dev setup.  I have not included many pros and cons for each setup because most of them are covered in Part I.
Solution 1. Buy a new machine This is a good solution if you are planning to buy a new machine or if are ready to buy a machine just for Keptn development.</description>

      <description>Based on my Keptn slack thread: https://keptn.slack.com/archives/CGS63H8G6/p1634057060065400
I am sharing this here with a paraphrase to the original thread and some extra info. This is so that:
 The entire thing is available publicly (Keptn slack needs signing up) (hopefully) Gives the original thread more context and structure with some follow up information  Problem: Keptn local development setup can be heavy if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a computer with good specifications.</description>
