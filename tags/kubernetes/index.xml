      <description>This is a group of short to-the-point notes as comments in the code. For comprehensive documentation, look at the official docs.
Notes:
 Manually linking the PV and PVC like this means even if the PVC is deleted PV won&amp;rsquo;t be deleted automatically. You&amp;rsquo;ve to delete the PV manually.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31  apiVersion:v1kind:PersistentVolumemetadata:# even if the PV name is different from the PVC name, as long as the storage size # and the PV storage class match with the PVC, kubernetes will link them togethername:&amp;#39;suraj-bankar2&amp;#39;spec:accessModes:[&amp;#39;ReadWriteOnce&amp;#39;]capacity:# storage here needs to match with the storage field in the PVC# if that doesn&amp;#39;t happen, Kubernetes won&amp;#39;t bind this PV to the `suraj-bankar` PVCstorage:100MipersistentVolumeReclaimPolicy:Delete# our PV needs to have the same storage class # (or the default storage class should be `standard`).</description>

      <description>Problem How do you fetch metrics for a specific time period from SumoLogic programmatically in your go code using SumoLogic-Labs/sumologic-go-sdk?
Solution If you are in a hurry, the code sits here. The SDK sits here.
1. Find the correct Sumo Logic API endpoint If the Sumo Logic you are using is in us1 region, your Sumo Logic API endpoint is: https://api.sumologic.com/api
If it is not in us1 region your Sumo Logic API endpoint would be: https://api.</description>

      <title>Using Telepresence V2 with remote Keptn cluster does not work when writing an integration</title>

      <description>This port is based on my slack thread in Keptn community here. I am writing it here so that it gets public visibility.
PSA: Using Telepresence V2 with remote Keptn cluster does not work when writing an integration. Problem/Context How do you do local development for a Keptn Integration if your laptop/PC cannot handle running a Keptn cluster locally with an IDE like VSCode and a web browser? I recently wrote a blogpost on it here.</description>

      <description>Introduction You are somewhat familiar with Kubernetes and you came across Keptn. You want to contribute but you are someone who falls into one of the following categories:
 You haven&amp;rsquo;t contributed to an open source project before The idea of going from zero to contributing to a big project like Keptn sounds overwhelming to you You would like someone who has done it tell you what exactly you need to do to get your first PR in You are a fan of TODO guides and would like a reference for making your own TODO guide for contributing to Keptn  Or something else that I might have missed.</description>

      <description>Part I: https://vadasambar.com/post/kubernetes/keptn/dev-setup/
This post details:
 Considering each option listed in Part I in more detail What I eventually ended up with. Hopefully 1 and 2 can give you some idea about what you can do for your local Keptn dev setup.  I have not included many pros and cons for each setup because most of them are covered in Part I.
Solution 1. Buy a new machine This is a good solution if you are planning to buy a new machine or if are ready to buy a machine just for Keptn development.</description>

      <description>Based on my Keptn slack thread: https://keptn.slack.com/archives/CGS63H8G6/p1634057060065400
I am sharing this here with a paraphrase to the original thread and some extra info. This is so that:
 The entire thing is available publicly (Keptn slack needs signing up) (hopefully) Gives the original thread more context and structure with some follow up information  Problem: Keptn local development setup can be heavy if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a computer with good specifications.</description>
